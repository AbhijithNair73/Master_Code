Monostate singleton: member variable static hoga. So even if you create many instances but the data member is static, so it is kind of singleton.
But it is considered very bad bcoz of inheriting the static data member will not be possible.

Singleton get_instance can be of two type:
1. Static object => which will be created only once and returned for the entire life of program.
2. Using pointers.

In Singleton make the default constructor private.
delete or make private copy and assignment operator.

So when using 1. static object type singleton pattern, we cannot assign get_instance() into any variable like below.
Singleton variable = Singleton::get_instance()   //error assignment operator private.

So for such case we can use pointer implementation.

Decorator
It is also known as a Wrapper.

Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.

Identification: Decorator can be recognized by creation methods or constructor that accept objects of the same class or interface as a current class.

Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide flexible alternatives to subclassing for extending functionality.

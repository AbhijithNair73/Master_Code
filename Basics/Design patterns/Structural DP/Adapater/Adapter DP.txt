Adapter pattern is 
Convert the interfac e of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that couldn' t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces

Structure
A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another:
An object adapter relies on object composition:
Participants
• Target (Shape)
- defines th domain-specific interface that Client uses.
• Client (DrawingEditor)
- collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
• Adaptee (TextView)
- defines a enxisting interface that needs adapting.
• Adapter (TextShape)
- adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.


UML:
 Client (DrawingEditor) ---> Target (Shape)---   --- Adaptee (TextView)
 											 |   |
 											 |   |
 									Adapter (TextShape)
 									           |   
 											   |  
Clients call operations on an Adapter instance. In turn, the adapter calls
Adaptee operations that carry out the specific request (only present in adaptee).

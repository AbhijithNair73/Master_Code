object creation at run time and done by some separate function or a class(factories).(single step object creation)
heirarchies of such factory classes(Abstract factory)

Inner factory means : factoryclass will be inside the actual class so it can access the private members of the actual class(constructor(if private)).
This was done to avoid breaking Openclose principle with making the factory class as a friend class in the actual class.


A factory is basically object creation:
	1. using some method or static function then its Factory method.
	2. If by some class then factory
		a. Internal (Nested class ) access to private members
		b. Abstract external class
	3. Heirarhcies of factories can be used for object creation.


In builder you create object in many steps, several different calls etc.(piece wise object creation)

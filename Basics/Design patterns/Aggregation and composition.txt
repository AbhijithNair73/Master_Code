call by reference
where value is passed by reference, so when this class dies, other class may or may not die based on the implementation
Hence a class where one dies other may or may not die such relation is called aggregation

composition mein doosre class ka object isme hi hota he.
So when this class object dies that class also dies.
That kind of relation where one class dies other also dies is also called compostion
